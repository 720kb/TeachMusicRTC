### Music e-learning app utilizing WebRTC and pitch detection.

**You are a Music Teacher**

With TeachRTC you can teach music easily to your students by sending them a link to your teaching session.
This app uses WebRTC, the same technology that google hangout uses, it lets you stream video browser-to-browser, directly to your student.
The cool thing then, is that has pitch-detection mixed in, so that the student actually gets a music sheet and he can visualize the notes you play! How cool is that?
